Programs for simulation of strategies for managing multiple recessives in a dairy cattle population
===================================================================================================

This is a set or programs for simulating approaches to the problem of managing a
large number of Mendelian recessives in a dairy cattle population, aand analysing
the resulting data. The programs are general enough that they can probably be
adapted to work with other species without much difficulty.
